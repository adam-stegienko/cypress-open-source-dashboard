# cypress-open-source-dashboard

Run `sudo ./init.sh` to begin the project.

Then move the services' directories to the VMs you would like to set the services up on.

**IMPORTANT** - the VMs must have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed as a pre-requisite.

### Credits
The project was inspired by an open-source cypress dashboard, sorry-cypress.
